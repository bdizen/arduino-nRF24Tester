# arduino-nRF24Tester
This project uses an Arduino microcontroller to test the performance of an NRF24L01 wireless module. It aims to measure factors such as latency and packet loss, as well as determining the optimal frequency bandwidth for operation in a specific environment. The project uses Arduino Micro to control the NRF24L01 module and collect data, which can then be analyzed to better understand the module's performance characteristics and fine-tune the settings for best performance.
